## Iteration Notes

a. Post-Playtest: Three changes made based on playtesting
1- Originally was going to have geometry- dash style game where you jump over obstacles. Decided I wanted to have a falling mechanic instead.
2- I added the ability for the player to speed up by pressing the up arrow key.
3- I was going to have the screen "flash" when you die but decided against it because it did not look good.

b. Post-Showcase: Two planned improvements
One planned imporvment would be to make another level, and also to make the level harder.
